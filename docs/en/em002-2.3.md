This checklist is part of *Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing Open
Source Software* \[Em002-2\]. It concludes the instructions and results
in release of the software under an open source licence. The description
of the checklist can be found in \[Em002-2\] Annex D.

# Subject matter

## Name and brief description of the software

Enter the name of the software.

|  |
|  |
|  |

## Contact person and review

Name the organisation, contact person from the specialist office and the
persons responsible (e.g. ISBO/DSBO) who have verified compliance with
the publication requirements.

|  |
|  |
|  |

## Repository names and developer permissions

State the planned repository names of the software to be published and
the chosen publication platform (currently this is usually GitHub).

|  |
|  |
|  |

Specify who (GitHub username, name, position, function) is working on
the repository. If this is in a repository of an office, it must be
stated who authorised the person. That person is then also responsible
for the solution if the first person leaves the organisation or changes
their position. It should also be specified whether individuals are
acting as private persons or as part of the office. Name the GitHub user
account that should be assigned the role of Repository Administrator.
There can be several administrators.
