# Use of these guidelines

Under Article 9 of the Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means to
Carry Out Official Tasks (EMOTA), the Confederation is required to
disclose the source code of software that it develops or commissions for
the performance of its duties.\[5\] The DTI Sector of the Federal
Chancellery has derived overarching objectives from this legal mandate
in the Strategic Guidelines for Open Source Software.

This document serves as practical guidelines on the legal and strategic
requirements. It is designed to assist federal administrative units in
the use, procurement and release of open source software. It provides
all interested parties with a comprehensive overview of the subject and
refers to additional information in the other resources.

However, depending on your prior knowledge and needs, you may wish to
read the guides selectively before moving on to the other tools. The
following outline will help you find the appropriate starting point. If
you are unsure, it is recommended that you read through the guidelines
first.

# Definitions

| Open source software | Software is considered open source software (OSS) when it is published under one of approximately 80 licences recognised by the Open Source Initiative OSI [OSI2019]. Specifically, the definition of open source sets out ten criteria that all open source licences must meet [PE1999]. These can essentially be summarised in four points:

The software may be used for any purpose.
The source code of the software is freely accessible.
The software may be copied and distributed without restriction.
The software may be modified and distributed in modified form under certain conditions. |
| --- | --- |
| Free
software | Before the term 'open source', the Free Software Foundation (FSF) introduced the concept of 'free software' in the 1980s. In essence, free software meets the conditions of open source software, but aims to ensure that the software is always freely accessible and, wherever possible, is not integrated into proprietary software.[6] |
| Proprietary
software | With proprietary software, a supplier develops software and sells a usage licence to the user. Generally, the user does not know the software code and may not redistribute or modify the software. They can only use the software according to the licence terms (e.g. End-User Licence Agreement, EULA) in return for payment of licence fees. For example, the software may be authorised to be used by only a certain number of users or a certain number of processors.[7] In return for the usually annual maintenance fees, the supplier commits to fixing errors within a reasonable timeframe and to continuously developing the software. |
| Licence | A licence is a document that contains binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software. In the case of open source, licences that comply with OSI are usually used.[8] |
| Community | A community in the context of open source software is broadly defined. It can be a loose ecosystem or a structure with governance that develops the software. The document [Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md) covers this topic. Community members can jointly manage the product, develop, test, translate, provide feedback or simply use the software. |
| Third-party rights | Even with open source software, protective rights may exist (copyright, trademark law, patent law) and can be asserted by third parties, e.g. when using source code created by third parties. |
| Exceptions under EMOTA | Exceptions according to Art. 9 para. 1 EMOTA include third-party rights and security-related reasons. Both are discussed in Section 3 of Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing Open Source Software. |
| Source code | In computing, source code (or source text) is the human-readable text of a computer program written in a programming language.[9] |
| Publication | Publication primarily refers to the release of the source code under an open licence according to OSI. For practical reasons, this usually also includes documentation and automated instructions for building the application from the source code. Automated tests and test documents are also typically included. To enable a community to develop, a platform is used that then takes on several functions of a development platform (build, test, support). |
| Digital
sovereignty | We use the definition from the FDFA's Digital Sovereignty Report [St2024]: 'Digital sovereignty of a state or organisation necessarily includes complete control over stored and processed data as well as independent decision-making about who may access it. It further includes the ability to independently develop, modify, control and supplement technological components and systems.' |
| Repository | A repository is a storage location used by a version control tool for files and metadata about the code base.
Repositories allow multiple contributors to work on the same files and store different versions. Most also allow issue tracking, release management, automated builds and documentation. |
| Fork | A fork[10] of an open source project is the process of setting up an independent development of the original project. |
| Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA) | A Contributor Licence Agreement[11] is a document that describes the conditions under which intellectual property can be contributed to a project or venture. |
| Source code management (SCM) | Source code management[12], also known as version control, is a tool that effectively manages changes and version numbers, particularly in software development. The free software Git[13] for managing distributed SCM has become established. |
| Open source software development (OSSD) | In open source software development (OSSD),[14] in addition to publishing the source code, the entire development process is carried out publicly. Everything from requirements (issues) to source code is transparent. OSSD is supported by public communication tools (mailing lists, forums, etc.), a version control system (git), bug and feature lists, roadmap and developer tools. |
| Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) | Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)[15] describes a standard format for Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) with the aim of facilitating the correct handling of free software or open source software. |
| Copyleft
effect | If software is under a licence with a copyleft provision, any modification or extension of the source code must be released again under the licence of the modified open source software (see also [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md) [Em002-3]). |

# Potential and challenges

There is enormous potential for open source software in today's world of
IT. At the same time, the use of open source solutions also brings
challenges. These two sides are explained in more detail in the
following section. The information is based on, among other things, the
results of the Open Source Study Switzerland 2018, 2021 and 2024 by the
University of Bern, in which respondents provided information about the
recognised advantages and disadvantages of open source software.

## Potential of open source software

The following points describe the potential that can be realised when
using and releasing open source software.

| Digital
sovereignty | This involves the ability to use and control digital services. Digital sovereignty extends over the entire lifecycle of a digital system.
Open source software promotes digital sovereignty as the software can in any case be independently further developed.[16] |
| --- | --- |
| No licence fees | There are no licence costs for using open source software. However, when obtaining complex standard open source software packages, it may make sense to purchase support subscriptions, for which a fee is paid. |
| Cost savings through cooperation with other users | As software under an open source licence can be used and further developed without restriction, costs of further developments can be shared or existing additional developments from other administrative units can be adopted according to the principle of 'develop once – use multiple times'. At the same time, there is the opportunity to benefit from the experience and developments of others. |
| Community building &amp; knowledge
sharing | Open source software facilitates community building and knowledge sharing, for example between the different federal levels in Switzerland. Software can be jointly further developed, errors fixed and individual experiences shared. The increased exchange of knowledge between different administrative units leads to a better understanding of what others are working on, so that duplication is avoided and the best solutions can spread. |
| Less vendor lock-in | Vendor lock-in (dependency on software suppliers) is considered very high in computing. Using software under an open source licence reduces vendor lock-in as operation, maintenance, support, further development and other services for open source software can be openly tendered. |
| Open standards and
interoperability | With open source software, compatibility with other software solutions and IT systems (interoperability) is generally higher than with proprietary software. Open source solutions also use almost exclusively open data formats, which is why they can be easily exchanged with other systems. |
| Transparency about the
structure of the software | As the software is also available in the form of source code, its quality can be checked, for example, through external reviews. In addition, documentation can be created based on the source code (e.g. with regard to new tenders for further development services or the replacement of open source software at the end of its service life). |
| Security and trust through transparency | Because of the open nature of the source code, the security of open source software can be higher than that of proprietary software. Moreover, it is much more difficult to build backdoors and other loopholes into open source software, which leads to more trust in the software. |
| Higher quality and modularity of code | The quality of open source software can be higher than proprietary software because the motivation to write good code may be greater when developers know that their source code will be published. In addition, open source solutions tend to be highly modular, so that individual modules can be easily replaced and the remaining modules can continue to be used.[17] |
| Easy
customisation | Access to the source code allows users to make further developments themselves or through external suppliers. This means the software can be quickly adapted to their own needs. |
| Rapid innovation and integration | There is rapid, continuous further development of open source software by the community. For example, new technologies and data standards are often published as open source programming libraries. This enables the rapid realisation of innovative software solutions. |
| Employer
attractiveness | The use of modern open source technologies and informal collaboration with international communities promotes employee motivation and thus increases employer attractiveness, which in turn facilitates the recruitment of young, qualified professionals. |

## Challenges in dealing with OSS

The following describes the typical challenges encountered in practice
with open source software and outlines some possible solutions. We do
not address general challenges that affect all software at this point
(e.g. the need to check for cybersecurity and the need to secure
appropriate support for critical software).

| High switching costs due to
existing
dependencies | Replacing proprietary software with open source solutions can be very costly if the application is closely embedded in the existing IT system through interface integration or other dependencies. These switching costs mean that introducing open source software often only pays off at the end of the proprietary software's lifecycle. |
| --- | --- |
| Missing features or no suitable open source solution | When procuring standard software, it may happen that there is no open source software alternative to the (previous) proprietary solution, or only one that is functionally inadequate. As a solution approach, there is the possibility of jointly developing the missing features together with other users of the open source software and adding them to the open source project.[18] |
| Higher integration costs | Short-term cost savings resulting from licence savings when using open source software are often offset by higher integration costs. Therefore, it is important to recognise that the professional use of open source software is not 'free' but actually generates internal or external costs. |
| Unclear
responsibilities
and support | Open source software is often criticised for the lack of support and maintenance by external companies. However, there are now a variety of suppliers offering commercial services (long-term support, ongoing maintenance, further development, liability and warranty, etc.) for open source solutions. The different business models with open source software are explained in Annex D and the different support models in Section 8. An up-to-date overview of open source service providers and their services can be found in the Open Source Directory (https://www.ossdirectory.com) or in the OSS Study 2024[19] [OSS2024]. |
| Small market with few suppliers | As certain open source applications, such as desktop applications, generally require little or no support and maintenance, there may be little market for open source providers of support and maintenance. In this case, a tendering process for open source software services can help to create a market that increases competition between suppliers. The existence of a broad development community for the software in question and the quality of the development documentation are of practical importance when tendering for such services. |
| Low visibility | Communities of open source projects focus primarily on product development and rarely on marketing. In contrast, manufacturers of proprietary software invest heavily in marketing and selling their products. This lack of advertising for open source software often creates the false impression that there is no alternative to proprietary products. However, there are platforms such as alternativeTo[20] that provide an overview of solutions for specific tasks (more on OSS alternatives in Section 0). |
| Lack of acceptance by end users | Due to different user interfaces, missing functions, low user-friendliness and little advertising for open source software, there is a lack of acceptance by end users for certain open source products. Appropriate communication, documentation and training offerings can counteract this challenge. The fact that open source software can be further developed according to users' needs can also lead to higher acceptance. |
| Little or no in-house expertise | Open source solutions evolve rapidly and at the same time require in-depth technical understanding. Thus, it may happen that internal employees have little or no expertise with certain open source software. In-house OSS know-how can be built up through further training and opportunities for self-study via online sources and building in-house wikis, etc. |
| Difficult future assessment | It is often difficult for outsiders of an open source community to recognise how the project will develop in the future. Therefore, it is important to be able to make a realistic assessment of the future development of an open source solution. In this regard, Section 7.2 introduces the Open Hub platform, which allows an assessment of the activity and heterogeneity of the developer community. This makes it possible to better assess the future development of an open source project. |
| Legal uncertainties | The multitudes of different open source licences and small number of court rulings on interpretation issues to date can sometimes lead to legal uncertainties with open source software. These practical guidelines are intended to provide an overview of the most important open source licences and their characteristics and compatibilities. Sources for in-depth answers to legal questions can be found in the documents [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md) [Em002-3] and in [Em002-6 FAQ on OSS and Art. 9 EMOTA](em002-6.md) [Em002-6]. |
| Too extensive offering of open source software | The number of open source software products has increased dramatically in recent years. Potential users of open source software therefore complain about the multitude of existing open source solutions on the market. For this reason, Section 0 '
Findability of ' introduces two platforms, alternativeTo and Open Hub, which enable a comparison of Open Source solutions. |

4.  # Constellations for using/working with OSS
    
    1.  ## Overview of OSS constellations

When using and developing OSS in the Federal Administration, there are
various constellations regarding the obligations related to open source
licences:

| Constellation | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| The mere use of existing open source software (without modifying the code). | There is no obligation to share the source code. |
| The complete new development of software that is be published under an open source licence. | In this case, there is complete freedom regarding the licence under which the software is published. The document [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md) should be used for the Confederation. The document [Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS](em002-2.md) and [Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md) must be observed. |
| Further development (internal or external) with existing open source components (with or without copyleft effect[21]), as long as the software is used exclusively within the same organisation and not redistributed. | The OSS components can be combined with third-party components as required. There is generally no publication obligation from the licence, as long as the software is used exclusively within the same organisation and not distributed (exception: AGPL). Since it is not legally conclusive how far the concept of 'distribution within the same organisation' extends, this scenario only applies in exceptional cases for OSS components with copyleft effects. In these cases, consult your organisation's legal department. See [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md) and Em002-6 FAQ on OSS and Art.9 EMOTA. The document [Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS](em002-2.md) and [Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md) must be observed. As there is a publication obligation under Art. 9 EMOTA, the changes must be re-released. The easiest way is as changes to the existing open source project. |
| Further development (internal or external) exclusively with existing open source components without copyleft effect, if the software is to be distributed externally (e.g. to cantons). | The OSS components can be combined with third-party components at will, and there is no publication obligation from the licences (see also [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md) [Em002.3]). However, release is mandatory within the framework of Art. 9 EMOTA. Ideally, the release should made be via the existing project (no fork). The document [Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS](em002-2.md) and [Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md) must be observed. |
| Further development (internally or externally) with existing open source components with copyleft effect, if the software is to be distributed externally (e.g. to cantons). | There is an obligation to publish due to the copyleft licence (see also [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md) regarding the copyleft effect). The document [Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS](em002-2.md) and [Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md) must be observed. |
| Contributing to an existing open source project. | There is generally a publication obligation according to EMOTA.
The governance and licence of the project are used. The document [Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS](em002-2.md) and [Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md) must be observed. |
| Joint development of a new or existing project with a community and cost sharing. | There is generally a publication obligation according to EMOTA. The documents [Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS](em002-2.md), [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md) and [Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md) are used to set up the project and its governance. |
| All variants of development or further development are carried out via a supplier or commissioned third party. | There is generally a publication obligation according to EMOTA.
Based on [Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing OSS](em002-2.md), [Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md) and [Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md). The procurement process should, where possible, create the conditions and, where necessary, transfer the requirements for release to the supplier/third party. |

## Use of unmodified open source software

When using open source software, it is generally not relevant under
which open source licence it is published, as all open source licences
(see Section 2 'Definitions') allow the unrestricted use of open source
software, regardless of how many workstations, simultaneously logged-in
users, number of servers and processors, etc. the software is used on.

When using unmodified open source software, **no publication
obligations** arise even for programs that are under a licence with a
strict copyleft effect (exception: AGPL licence, Affero General Public
Licence).

As long as open source software is introduced and operated by internal
federal service providers, this can be done **without a public
procurement procedure**, because "the OSS licence alone generally costs
the procuring entity nothing and is therefore not relevant to
procurement in itself."<sup>18</sup>

If an external service provider is commissioned for maintenance, support
and other services for the open source software, the requirements of
public procurement law must be observed. Different support variants are
described in Section 9. It is also important to use appropriate
suitability and award criteria when procuring open source software. The
basis for this is explained in Section 8.

## Development with open source components and release of source code

With the publication obligation according to Art. 9 EMOTA, the procedure
described in *Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing Open Source Software*
should be followed here.  
The documents *[Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md)* and *Em002-4 OSS
Community Guidelines* must also be consulted if necessary. The goal is
to release the project in a controlled manner using the three checklists
*\[Em002-2.1\], \[Em002-2.2\], \[Em002-2.3\]*.

## Collaboration in open projects (contribution)

Possible considerations for the Federal Administration's contribution to
open, existing projects are listed at
<https://www.bitkom.org/Bitkom/Publikationen/Bitkom-Leitfaden-zu-Open-Source-Software-20.html>
in Section 4.2. Possible considerations for the Federal Administration's
contribution to open, already existing projects are listed in the BITKOM
guide \[BITCOM2024\] Section 4.2.\[22\] Depending on the importance of
the project for the Federal Administration, it should be examined how
much responsibility the respective office wants to and can assume.

Collaboration in open projects and direct development in open projects
can also take place using the documents for release. The focus is on
*[Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md)* and the *checklist \[Em002-4.1\]*.

# Properties and selection of open source licences

The properties and selection of open source licences are described in
the document *[Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md).*

# OSS procurement

This and the following sections deal with the procurement and unchanged
use of open source software. The focus is on the *Procurement and EMOTA
information sheet*,\[23\] which is relevant for IT services and works.
The following are also of interest:

  - Tender registration

  - Tender kick-off slides

  - The document *[Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md)* may also be useful.

  - The overview of open source software used, released and co-developed
    can also be consulted.

The enterprise readiness of open source can be found in the document
*Selection Criteria for Enterprise-Ready Open Source Software*
\[Gu2024\]\[24\] or in the Bitkom guide\[25\] or at
<https://www.bitkom.org/Bitkom/Publikationen/Bitkom-Leitfaden-zu-Open-Source-Software-20.html>,
Section 3.3.

# Findability of OSS alternatives / solutions

Various platforms allow interested organisations to find and analyse
open source software before use or procurement. The resulting data
provide a basis for deciding on the use or procurement of open source
software.

A compilation of minimum requirements and possibly a market analysis
should serve in any case.

## alternativeTo

A practical tool for finding alternatives to software is 'alternativeTo
- Crowdsourced software recommendations'.\[26\] As the name suggests,
the alternatives and their ratings have been created through
crowdsourcing, i.e. the input of many individual users. alternativeTo
distinguishes four types of software solutions, of which only the first
is considered open source software in the sense of Art. 9 EMOTA:

| **Free open source** | Software that is published under an open source licence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**             | Free software (freeware) but whose source code is not freely available and may not be modified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Freemium**         | Such software offers a free and a premium version, with all important functionalities already available in the free version. This category does not include software that can be tested free of charge for a certain period of time (e.g. a 30-day trial version), which falls into the 'Commercial' category. |
| **Commercial**       | This is proprietary software for which licence fees are charged when used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Open source repositories

Currently, the world's most popular open source development platform
with over 30 million users and over 100 million source code repositories
is GitHub.\[27\] Today, practically all IT companies, especially
manufacturers of proprietary software, as well as many other types of
company and organisation, have a GitHub presence. More and more public
authorities – about a dozen from Switzerland\[28\] – also publish their
own open source software on 'GitHub and Government' at
<https://government.github.com>. This process can also be carried out
with other repositories.

Examples of other repositories are:

  - GitLab

  - Bitbucket

  - SourceForge

  - LaunchPad

On GitHub Insights, numerous relevant statistics of an Open Source
project on GitHub can be read:

| **Pulse**            | Overview of the recent activities of an open source project on GitHub: Summary of the most important information about development intensity, community heterogeneity, open reports, improvements (pull requests), etc. |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contributors**     | Display of which developers have been active and when. This is an important indicator of whether everything depends on one person or whether there is a larger community behind it.                                     |
| **Commits**          | Display of which contributions were made to this open source project in which time period.                                                                                                                              |
| **Code frequency**   | Visualisation of how much source code was added or removed and when.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Dependency graph** | Dependencies of the open source project on other open source software (e.g. relevant for identifying security vulnerabilities and updates).                                                                             |

| **Forks**            | List of all copies of the open source project on GitHub. Indicator of the popularity and distribution of the open source software.                                                                                      |

## Open Hub

If information is to be collected on an open source solution that is not
necessarily developed on GitHub, Open Hub by Black Duck is a good
option.\[29\] A wealth of important information is clearly summarised
for around half a million open source projects:

| Project Summary | A brief description of the open source project. |
| --- | --- |
| In a Nutshell | The most important facts about an open source project, such as the number of commits, contributors and lines of code, as well as the most used programming language, the time of the first commit and last change. In addition, an assessment of the code base and the size of the development team is listed (e.g. 'Mozilla Firefox has a well-established, mature codebase maintained by a very large development team with stable Y-O-Y commits'). |
| Quick
Reference | Contains information about the organisation, links to the project and the code, as well as references to similar projects. |
| Licences | Indicates the licence(s) under which the open source project is licensed and what consequences are associated with it. |
| Project Security | Provides information on the security and vulnerabilities of the open source project. |
| Code | A graph showing the number of lines of code over time, broken down by programming language. |
| Activity | A graph showing the number of commits per month. A summary of the last 30 days and 12 months is also provided. |
| Community | A graph showing the number of active contributors per month is displayed. A rating of the project is also displayed on a five-star scale. |

Open Hub also allows you to compare different open source
projects.\[30\] This quickly provides an overview of which project has
the most active community, the longest development time or the most
suitable licence.

## Special code repositories

Larger organisations have their own code repositories. Particularly
noteworthy is, for example, the German repository for authorities
opencode.de.\[31\] Repositories from other public administrations are of
particular interest here.

## OSS Directory

Open Source organisations sometimes maintain directories of interesting
open source software and companies that can support this.  
In Switzerland, this is the OSS Directory of CH Open.\[32\]

# Support models for OSS use

Open source software already available on the market can basically be
used in three ways:

1.  Use without professional support

2.  Use with internal support

3.  Use with support from an external supplier.

These three types of use and their advantages and disadvantages are
briefly explained below. Which of these scenarios makes the most sense
in a particular case must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Which
support model is suitable depends on the strategic relevance of the open
source software, the technical integration and the available personnel
resources.

For critical software, support must be provided professionally in any
case, whether internally or externally. The planned lifecycle should
also play a role in support planning. It may also be that support is
obtained from multiple providers.

## Use without professional support

Open source software is free to download, install and use.

| Advantages | Low cost


Rapid implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Disadvantages | No guaranteed support


No liability claims |
| Risk and safeguarding | High risk: There are no support contracts or guarantees and there is little or no developer expertise in the organisation. |
| Typical area of application | Standard open source software that can be updated independently of other systems. |

## Use with internal support

A company or public sector organisation builds up expertise and
resources in specific open source solutions for long-term use. This
approach is particularly common in business-critical areas.

| Advantages | High flexibility thanks to internal know-how


No supplier lock-in |
| --- | --- |
| Disadvantages | High investment and time required to build up expertise


Higher internal fixed costs for staff |
| Risk and safeguarding | Medium risk: Support depends on know-how and availability of internal IT. |
| Typical area of application | In-house development, strategically used open source software for which in-depth know-how is available. |

## Use with support from external supplier

An external open source provider is brought in to professionally
accompany the rollout and maintenance of the open source software. This
approach is particularly used in business-critical areas where in-depth
know-how of the software must be immediately available. This can also
include parts of or the entire release.

| Advantages | Direct access to the know-how of open source developers


Fixes and enhancements on a contract basis


Selection of different open source suppliers


Commitment, safeguarding against compliance risks |
| --- | --- |
| Disadvantages | External costs through open source suppliers


Know-how dependency on open source supplier |
| Risk and safeguarding | Low risk: Warranty is provided according to terms of reference or service level agreement |
| Typical area of application | Business-critical open source software where little or no in-house development expertise is available |

# Contact point

There is no single point of contact in the Federal Administration that
provides information on open source topics. In principle, federal
offices are responsible for implementation themselves.

General enquiries about the OSS tools in the Em002 document set can be
directed to the DTI Sector of the Federal Chancellery:

## Business models with OSS

Open source software is not a business model per se because, unlike with
proprietary software, it is not possible to sell software under an open
source licence. Nevertheless, there are different possibilities for
companies to operate business models based on open source software. For
example, if professional external support is to be obtained for an open
source solution, then the procurement of corresponding commercial
services is necessary. The four most common business models for open
source software are explained below. Additional aspects of these and
other business models are explained in the BITKOM guidelines
\[BIT-KOM2023\].

### D.1 Services and products based on OSS

Companies can offer commercial services such as web hosting or cloud
computing based on open source software, which would be much more
expensive with proprietary software. As a result, most start-ups, online
portals and e-commerce providers today build their platforms on open
source software. Other technology companies such as telecommunications
companies, streaming providers or even manufacturers of proprietary
software integrate open source software into their software and hardware
products as well as online services. This allows companies to continue
to offer innovative solutions that would be difficult to achieve with
proprietary software.

### D.2 Services for OSS

Open source providers provide services for selected open source
software. They have experienced open source developers and can therefore
offer support, maintenance, operation, development, consulting, training
and other services for open source software. These can be obtained from
the open source supplier as a mandate or under a contract for work and
services. Such services for open source software can be publicly
tendered as there is no vendor lock-in. What is important for such
tenders is the consideration of appropriate criteria so that the service
providers that are actually competent are selected (see Sections 0 and
9, \[BITKOM2023\] Section 3.3 and \[Gu2024\]).

### D.3 Subscriptions

If services for open source software are provided in a standardised,
recurring form as a kind of service level agreement (SLA), these are
called subscriptions. As part of such subscriptions, companies
guarantee, for example, continuous security updates, support by email or
telephone, compatibility with other software and hardware products
through certifications, long-term maintenance services and safeguards
against legal claims (copyright, patents). In return, customers pay
subscriptions per workstation or CPU, similar to licence fees or usage
fees for proprietary software. Unlike proprietary software, however,
subscriptions for open source software are not a prerequisite for using
the software, but merely a way of paying for the added value of the
services provided by the open source supplier.

### D.4 Dual licensing

If a company owns the intellectual property of a software solution and
all integrated open source components are under a permissive licence,
then dual or multiple licensing can be applied. This allows the
developer company to publish the software under a copyleft open source
licence and also sell it under a proprietary licence. This commercial
version is often called the Enterprise version and typically includes
certain additional features, such as exclusive interface integrations or
permission for buyers to integrate the software into their own
proprietary products. Depending on the extent of the restrictions of the
open source version, caution is advised when using dual-licensed
software, as obtaining the Enterprise version may be unavoidable, making
the vendor lock-in as high as with typical proprietary software.

16. We use the definition from \[St2024\]: 'Digital sovereignty of a
    state or organisation necessarily includes complete control over
    stored and processed data as well as independent decision-making
    about who may access it. It further includes the ability to
    independently develop, modify, control and supplement technological
    components and systems.'

17. Another aspect of security is that it is easier to document the
    libraries used (including dependencies) than in proprietary
    software. This in turn means that when vulnerabilities occur, they
    can be quickly identified and fixed (see also SBOM).

18. Project or application managers are responsible for such new
    features. The project determines exactly how this is done. Em002-2
    and Em002-4 help with detailed decisions. Depending on the size of
    the feature, it may not make sense to go through the instructions in
    full. Procurement law aspects for resources must be observed.
