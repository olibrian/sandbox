| A | Open source refers to software whose source code is freely accessible and modifiable under minimum conditions. This also includes custom-trained AI models (including the algorithm, training procedure, and code). AI models are trained on the basis of data, possibly Open (Government) Data\*. Open Data refers to datasets that are free to use, share and process. AI models with underlying training data based on Open (Government) Data are considered software subject to EMOTA and therefore must also be published. However, if the training data contains (sensitive) personal data or classified information, publication can be waived on security-relevant grounds. When open-sourcing an AI model, the training data does not necessarily have to be published; however, this is in keeping with the open source ethos and is strongly encouraged by the open source community. For further information regarding AI, we refer to the Competence Network for Artificial Intelligence (CNAI).\[5\] |

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td><p>Content generated by an AI model itself cannot be protected by copyright because there is no creative activity behind it. However, AI-generated content that draws on copyrighted works of third parties may infringe the rights of these third parties. Also, given that AI outputs are notoriously unreliable, they should only be used after careful examination in each case. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the operators of AI systems may reserve the right in their terms and conditions to use inputs to train the system. This, in turn, can lead to inputs or parts thereof being displayed to third parties. Where this cannot be ruled out, it must be ensured that inputs do not violate the rights of the Confederation or third parties.</p>
<p>It is recommended to examine and approve the use of AI tools individually. Unapproved tools may not be used, but employees can apply for approval of a tool. Often it makes sense to resolve such issues by contract with the supplier, or some suppliers may offer special subscriptions by which they respect third-party rights, e.g. DeepL.</p></td>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Third-party rights are violated</p></li>
<li><p>A federal authority refuses to publish OSS (citing security-relevant reasons that are not valid)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Answer to 1:</p>
<p>This will regularly be a breach of contract and claims for damages may be asserted in accordance with the Swiss Code of Obligations.</p>
<p>Answer to 2:</p>
<p>This has no direct consequence. If a third party wants to be able to use the source code of a federal authority, they have to submit a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA; SR 152.3) to the responsible authority. If there is a high level of interest, it may make sense to consider publication in the interest of both parties. There is no obligation to publish retroactively, although this can be done voluntarily.</p></td>

| Q | **Can liability claims be asserted in the case of damage caused by OSS?**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A | In principle, liability claims should be excluded in the contracts. However, it is not possible to exclude liability for gross negligence or culpable negligence. In such cases, a federal authority could be held liable under the Government Liability Act (GLA; SR 172.32). |

Art. 36 para. 2 FADP specifies the following exceptions, among others:</p>
<p>b. The data subject has consented to the disclosure.</p>
<p>e. The data subject has made their data generally accessible and has not explicitly prohibited processing.</p>
<p>In most cases, it is advisable to obtain the consent of the persons concerned in advance, as they usually also have an interest in their work being publicly visible. If consent is not given, or if there are other reasons against publication, the source code should be published without personal data, referring only to the federal authority concerned.</p>

## Quality criteria for OSS

| Q | **Does open source software have to meet certain quality criteria?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | As a rule, all quality criteria for any other software also applies. Open source primarily makes everything more transparent. To comply with the licence, the criteria for a 'good' release, and any community rules in place, some additional points are necessary. These are outlined in *Em002-2.2 Analysis and Preparation Checklist* and *Em002-4.1 OSS Community Checklist*. |

<td>A</td>
<td><p>No central requirements are planned. The rules of the federal authority (administrative units) developing the software are applicable.<br />
Apart from the general requirements, there are no special requirements for OSS quality. However, Hermes will be updated to incorporate Art. 9 EMOTA.</p>
<p>Publication is the Federal Administration's way of going public. If this is not done carefully and professionally, the public image of a federal authority can quickly suffer.</p></td>

# FAQ on legal matters

## Use of English

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Q</th>
<th><strong>Is the Confederation allowed to use licences in the original language English?</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td><p>According to Art. 9 para. 4 EMOTA, internationally established licence texts should be used wherever possible and practical.</p>
<p>Insisting on German-language OSS licences would largely negate the purpose of Art. 9 para. 4 EMOTA as there are very few internationally established licence texts where a version in one of Switzerland's official languages (German, French and Italian as specified in Art. 70 para. 1 Cst.) is recognised as authoritative for interpretation.</p>
<p>This situation parallels English-language courses at higher education institutions such as ETH, where English as the teaching language is permitted – subject to the three conditions under Article 36 of the Federal Constitution (St Gallen Commentary on the Federal Constitution, 4th ed. 2023, Art. 70 N 29; namely a legal basis, public interest, and proportionality must exist for English to be permitted).</p>
<p>Based on the above, Art. 9 para. 4 EMOTA should be interpreted as providing the legal basis for using English-language licences, since international licences are predominantly in English. The provision must therefore refer to these.</p>
<p>The public interest served by Art. 9 EMOTA includes interaction with relevant developer communities (EMOTA Dispatch, 66). In the computing industry, these communities are typically international and use English as their working language. Limiting licences to German would seriously impede, if not prevent entirely, collaboration with international communities, as software licensed this way would have little international uptake. This would also conflict with the intended purpose of Article 9 EMOTA.</p>
<p>Moreover, internationally established OSS licences are, by definition, valid worldwide. The legislator evidently intended to enable international use of the released software. Restricting OSS releases to German-language licences would severely limit the international usability of the released software.</p>
<p>Additionally, English is firmly established as the standard language in the computing industry's commercial sphere, which includes OSS releases. Using English-language licences therefore represents a reasonable and proportionate limitation on the contractual partners' rights. English-language licences are both appropriate and necessary to achieve the intended objectives.</p></td>

## Liability disclaimer

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Q</th>
<th><strong>Most OSS licences include liability disclaimers. Is this adequate, or are additional measures needed? What is the position regarding defective software? (including consideration of the Government Liability Act)</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td><p>The applicable licences exclude liability for slight negligence. Liability cannot be excluded for gross negligence or intentional acts. However, the practical liability risks are minimal.</p>
<p>Distributing modified software under a licence incompatible with the original software's licence (for instance, using an MIT licence without copyleft where the code originally used was under a GPL licence with copyleft) breaches the original licence. Due to the absence of good faith protection in intellectual property law, this neither allows other users to suddenly use the original software under the new licence, nor creates an enforceable obligation to offer the new licence under the original software's licence terms. The sole consequence is breach of the original licence, potentially resulting in damages claims (licence analogy) against a federal authority.</p>
<p>However, this risk can be managed through systematic checking according to the guidelines, as is now standard practice in the software industry. Specifically, licensing requires creating a bill of materials listing all pre-existing software incorporated into the new software, which must be strictly adhered to during licensing.</p>
<p>Where third-party rights exist, Art. 9 para. 1 EMOTA anyway does not require publication of the software in any case (or potentially only its newly written portions; this should be clarified in the guidelines).</p>
<p>Under Article 11 of the Government Liability Act, the Confederation's liability is governed by civil law when it acts as a civil law entity. This is the case under Art. 9 para. 2 EMOTA; consequently, additional liability under the Government Liability Act is excluded.</p></td>

## Permissive software

| Q | **If software is based on a library/program component published under a permissive licence, can the main software (excluding the library) be published under a non-permissive licence?** |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | Yes, this is unproblematic. See the information provided in the guidelines \[Em002-3\].                                                                                                  |

## Licence provisions

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Q</th>
<th><strong>Can software be used by several different offices? What licence provisions apply within the Federal Administration? Is the Federal Administration considered a corporate group? (This applies to unmodified open source software from third parties.)</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td>Distributing software under permissive licences is generally straightforward. However, with copyleft licences, the question arises whether distribution within the central or decentralised Federal Administration triggers copyleft obligations and thus risks compromising the confidentiality of the Confederation's own developments. When distributing to institutions of the decentralised Federal Administration that have their own legal personality, this is indeed the case, whereas it does not apply within the central Federal Administration, as all departments operate under the same legal entity.<br />
<br />
Corporate group companies are legally independent but remain under the economic control of the parent company. Legal literature considers the distribution of copyleft-licensed code to a group company as triggering copyleft obligations. Since group companies often receive open-source software during software development, they require their own right of use, meaning that distribution to a group company triggers copyleft obligations.<br />
<br />
In contrast, distribution within the central Federal Administration does not trigger copyleft obligations. However, for the decentralised Federal Administration, where separate legal entities exist, the above applies: distribution triggers copyleft obligations, and the software must be offered in source code form under the same licence terms as the original software. An instruction not to distribute the software to third parties would violate the licence and could also breach Art. 9 EMOTA.</td>

## Relationship between the FoIA and EMOTA

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Q</th>
<th><strong>How do the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) and EMOTA relate to each other?</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td><p>According to Article 5 para. 1 FoIA, official documents must be released. An official document is defined as any information recorded on any medium that is in the possession of an authority and relates to the performance of a public task. OSS fundamentally falls under the FoIA. The FoIA applies when an individual requests source code from a department or office for their own use. The office must disclose the source code to the person concerned unless exceptions under Article 7 FoIA apply. If the office refuses to disclose the source code, the FoIA procedure applies. A different case arises when someone demands that the office publish the source code on its website. Then the procedure would not follow the FoIA but EMOTA. Since EMOTA itself does not specify a procedure, general administrative law must suffice. This provides either the option of an administrative decision, a real act, or a general declaratory decision from the office concerned. This decision can then be appealed to the Federal Administrative Court.</p>
<p>While disclosure obligations for software developed by a federal authority under the FoIA are conceivable (if the relevant conditions are met), it should be noted that disclosure of software under the FoIA does not automatically grant an OSS licence. The use of software disclosed under the FoIA is thus limited to the purposes set by the FoIA, such as viewing the code or executing it for observation purposes. However, FoIA disclosure does not include a licence for regular use of the software or as a basis for further software development (details in T. Poledna/S. Schlauri/S. Schweizer, <em>Rechtliche Voraussetzungen der Nutzung von Open-Source-Software in der öffentlichen Verwaltung, insbesondere des Kantons Bern</em> [tr: Legal Requirements for the Use of Open Source Software in Public Administration, particularly in the Canton of Bern], Zurich 2017, https://carlgrossmann.com/?ddownload=11748, N 393 ff.).</p>
<p>The decision to license software as OSS, even if it falls under the FoIA, continues to follow EMOTA; there remains no entitlement to the granting of a licence.</p>
<p>Importantly, software developed before 1 January 2024, while not subject to EMOTA, must still be released according to the FoIA.</p></td>

## OSS and data protection

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Q</th>
<th><strong>Can developers' personal data be published without further consideration? What data protection aspects need to be considered?</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A</td>
<td><p>From a data protection perspective, publishing personal data (e.g. names or email addresses) is problematic unless employees have given prior consent. This is because the disclosure of personal data can, in principle, be avoided through pseudonymisation or anonymisation of repository entries, which would be required according to the principle of data minimisation and proportionality (Art. 6 para. 2 FADP).</p>
<p>However, such consent should generally be easy to obtain, as employees often have an interest in publicly demonstrating their capabilities (at noted in Poledna/Schlauri/Schweizer, N 68, with references). Consent may also be implied through the use of names in the repository, at least where no employer directive exists to the contrary.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is advisable to address the provider's responsibility for their employees' personal data in procurement contracts.</p></td>

# General

| Q | **Does it matter whether OSS is used commercially or non-commercially?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | Open source licences generally do not distinguish between commercial and non-commercial use. Therefore, OSS can be used for any purpose, including commercial applications. Commercial suppliers often try to integrate OSS components into proprietary products. This is only permissible if the OSS components are not under a licence with copyleft effects (see also *Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines)*. |

| Q | **Are there restrictions on which organisations are permitted for communities?** |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | This is still under review.                                                      |
