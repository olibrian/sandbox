| Q | **Should custom-built AI models be considered as software and thus subject to the legal requirements of EMOTA? What about the training data?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| A | Open source refers to software whose source code is freely accessible and modifiable under minimum conditions. This also includes custom-trained AI models (including the algorithm, training procedure, and code). AI models are trained on the basis of data, possibly Open (Government) Data\*. Open Data refers to datasets that are free to use, share and process. AI models with underlying training data based on Open (Government) Data are considered software subject to EMOTA and therefore must also be published. However, if the training data contains (sensitive) personal data or classified information, publication can be waived on security-relevant grounds. When open-sourcing an AI model, the training data does not necessarily have to be published; however, this is in keeping with the open source ethos and is strongly encouraged by the open source community. For further information regarding AI, we refer to the Competence Network for Artificial Intelligence (CNAI).\[5\] |



## Federal Act of 17 March 2023\[6\] on the Use of Electronic Means to Carry Out Official Tasks (EMOTA)



| Q | **What is meant by security-relevant reasons?**                                                                                                                                            |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A | The security-relevant reasons permitted under Art. 9 EMOTA and how to deal with them are defined in Section 3.2 of *Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing Open Source Software \[Em002-2\]*. |

| Q | **What are third-party rights?**                                                                                                                                      |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | Third-party rights under Art. 9 EMOTA and how to deal with them are defined in Section 3.3 of *Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing Open Source Software \[Em002-2\]*. |



| Q | **Can liability claims be asserted in the case of damage caused by OSS?**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A | In principle, liability claims should be excluded in the contracts. However, it is not possible to exclude liability for gross negligence or culpable negligence. In such cases, a federal authority could be held liable under the Government Liability Act (GLA; SR 172.32). |





| Q | **On what basis would a third party request the release of source code?**               |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | A third party would have to submit a request under the FoIA to the competent authority. |

## Quality criteria for OSS

| Q | **Does open source software have to meet certain quality criteria?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | As a rule, all quality criteria for any other software also applies. Open source primarily makes everything more transparent. To comply with the licence, the criteria for a 'good' release, and any community rules in place, some additional points are necessary. These are outlined in *[Em002-2.2 Analysis and Preparation Checklist](em002-2.2.md)* and *[Em002-4.1 OSS Community Checklist](em002-4.1.md)*. |



| Q | **How are development guidelines regulated?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | Apart from the general requirements set out in the tools, there are no special requirements regarding the development of open source software. Guidance is provided in *[Em002-2.2 Analysis and Preparation Checklist](em002-2.2.md)* and *[Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md)*. |

## Support

| Q | **Is the federal authority required to provide support for published software?**                              |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | No, but it can if it so wishes. According to Art. 9 paras 5 and 6 EMOTA, it may also charge fees for support. |

## Permissive software

| Q | **If software is based on a library/program component published under a permissive licence, can the main software (excluding the library) be published under a non-permissive licence?** |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | Yes, this is unproblematic. See the information provided in the guidelines \[Em002-3\].                                                                                                  |

# General

| Q | **Does it matter whether OSS is used commercially or non-commercially?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | Open source licences generally do not distinguish between commercial and non-commercial use. Therefore, OSS can be used for any purpose, including commercial applications. Commercial suppliers often try to integrate OSS components into proprietary products. This is only permissible if the OSS components are not under a licence with copyleft effects (see also *[Em002-3 OSS Licensing Guidelines](em002-3.md))*. |

| Q | **Are there restrictions on which organisations are permitted for communities?** |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A | This is still under review.                                                      |
