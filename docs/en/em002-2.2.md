This checklist is part of *Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing Open
Source Software* and is intended for ICT professionals. It serves to
review the documentation and source code of a project. In doing so, it
helps ensure that the quality level of the documentation is sufficient
to publish an application as open source. It can also be used to verify
that the source code and all third-party components used by the project
do not pose any legal risks. These measures minimise security risks.
Information about this checklist can be found in *\[Em002-2\]* in
Section 4.

Furthermore, this checklist ensures that the project documentation
addresses both end users and technical professionals equally.
