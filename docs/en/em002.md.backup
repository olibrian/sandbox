# Introduction

## Objective and purpose

Under Article 9 paragraph 1 of the Federal Act of 17 March 2023\[5\] on
the Use of Electronic Means to Carry Out Official Tasks (EMOTA), public
authorities must disclose the source code of software they develop or
commission to perform their duties, unless third-party rights or
security-relevant reasons preclude or restrict this. This eliminates
legal uncertainty regarding the publication of software by federal
authorities.

In recent years, it has become clear that the importance of open source
software (OSS) in the Federal Administration has generally continued to
increase.

These strategic guidelines describe the fundamentals of open source
software and how this is handled in the Federal Administration. The
document sets out six objectives and proposes nine measures to fulfil
these.

It also gives references to other relevant public sector strategies
regarding open source.

## Background

In 2005, the Federal IT Strategy Unit (FITSU) published the first
version of an OSS strategy for the Federal Administration. At that time,
the most important principle was defined as the equal treatment of OSS
with closed source software in procurement.

Since publication in 2005, the prevalence of open source software has
steadily increased. Today, according to the Open Source Study
Switzerland 2024 report, a clear majority of companies and authorities
use open source software in many different areas. In the software
industry, very few companies do not work with open source tools and
components.

On 1 February 2019, these *Strategic Guidelines for Open Source Software
in the Federal Administration* and the practical guidelines came into
force as Version 1.0. With the enactment of EMOTA and the new
obligations under Article 9, it became necessary to align both sets of
guidelines with the new status and create additional tools for the
federal authorities.

## Procedure

The federal offices are responsible for implementing EMOTA themselves.
However, given the growing importance of open source, it was decided to
revise the practical guidelines *\[Em002-1\]* together with all
stakeholders. Furthermore, additional tools for implementing EMOTA were
added.

The practical guidelines define the necessary concepts, set out the
constellations for using open source software, where and how
alternatives to existing commercial software can be found, how open
source should be procured, what business models exist for open source
and what support models are possible when using open source. The other
tools provide answers to frequently asked questions and guidance on
releasing open source software in accordance with EMOTA. They explore
all issues surrounding OSS licences and show how a community can be
built around software. Several checklists for guidance and documentation
are also made available to federal authorities.

Furthermore, documents have been adapted in the FOBL environment and an
additional information sheet is being prepared.

Existing uncertainties are resolved as far as possible with these
strategic guidelines, the accompanying practical guidelines and
recommendations for action, as well as the additional tools.

# Reference to other strategies

These *Strategic Guidelines for Open Source Software in the Federal
Administration* are aligned with four current public sector strategies
and EMOTA.\[6\] These contain a direct or indirect reference to the
topic of open source software and IT collaboration among public
institutions:

The ***Digital Federal Administration Strategy*** \[SB001\] sets out
eight principles and four priorities. By using open source software, the
Federal Administration contributes to priority 4, 'Strengthening digital
sovereignty'. An open source solution can be reused any number of times
and adapted to the individual needs of the Federal Administration due to
its open source code.

The concept of digital sustainability and digital sovereignty also comes
up in the ***Digital Public Services Switzerland Strategy
2024–2027***.\[7\] The Confederation and cantons will create
appropriate conditions for this multiple use. Basic modules for
expanding eGovernment will be 'implemented once and used jointly'.
Opting for open source software makes it easier to reuse IT solutions.

According to the ***Digital Switzerland Strategy***\[8\] it is crucial
for Switzerland's success in the digital space to strengthen the
networking of federal levels. Particular attention should therefore be
paid to coordination between the Confederation, cantons and communes as
well as cooperation between organisations active in the field of
digitalisation throughout Switzerland. The Federal Council also attached
particular importance to Switzerland's digital sovereignty as a focus
topic for 2023.\[9\]

In the ***Open Government Data Strategy Switzerland (2019–2023)***\[10\]
the Federal Council states that data from the Federal Administration
that is not personal and not security-critical should be published
according to the Open by Default principle. The Federal Administration
has launched the *opendata.swiss* portal for this purpose.\[11\] Federal
offices, cantons, cities and other public organisations have currently
published over 11,700 datasets there.

The Open Government Data Master Plan 2024–2027\[12\] implements the Open
by Default principle. 

# ![](./assets/em002//media/image1.png)Governance and tools

When talking about open source software, a distinction has to be made
between **consuming** (using), **contributing** (adding to existing
code) and **creating** (i.e. new projects).

When **consuming** open source software, it should be treated and
evaluated as equivalent to proprietary software.

When **developing** software, open source release is generally
mandatory, subject to the exceptions set out in Art. 9 EMOTA
(third-party rights and security-relevant reasons).  
These exceptions are addressed in *Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing
OSS*.  
The federal authorities, i.e. the administrative units of the Federal
Administration, are themselves responsible for correct compliance; there
is no centralised responsibility.

**Publication** brings added value especially when a **community** of
interested parties emerges and works together on the software. If the
community collaborates on a project and the Federal Administration
allows these contributions, economic benefits and synergy effects are
created.\[13\]  
In practice, release often consists of not only the source code, but
also all other aspects (documentation, governance, build instructions,
etc.).

In principle, the Federal Administration has no obligation to build
communities; the legal mandate only requires it to publish the source
code. The Federal Administration should prioritise investing in
communities where the benefit for the Confederation and third parties is
great and the effort is as low as possible.

Currently, there is no common federal platform for **developing and
publishing source code**. Each public authority must therefore select a
platform (repository) for publication itself. The practical guidelines
in *Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing Open Source Software* and the
associated checklists define how to work with a platform and which
properties it must fulfil.

The **choice of licence** is dealt with in the *OSS Licensing
Guidelines* \[Em002-3\], which presents a selection of standard licences
and explains their uses. The Federal Administration should only use its
own licence texts in justified cases according to Art. 9 para. 4 EMOTA.

When using and developing OSS, **support** must always be regulated
(even if it is waived). The responsible administrative unit regulates
this during the release process or when defining the community. EMOTA
does not make any provisions here, and no additional financing or
personnel will be made available for support. It may make sense to
include support and joint further development where the benefit for
Swiss authorities or the Swiss economy is considered sufficiently large
(ecosystem costs) and/or cost-sharing or cooperation is sought. If the
supplier takes this on, its support costs can be covered by the users.

The **procurement of OSS** is done via the Federal Administration's
regular procurement process. The FOBL provides the relevant documents
and tools such as the *Tender kick-off slides,* *Tender registration*
and *Procurement project templates.* In addition, a *Procurement and
EMOTA information sheet* is available\[14\] (see Figure 2).

Legal and practical considerations mean that under certain circumstances
the obligation to release OSS may be transferred to a supplier (during
the tender or in operation). The procurement tools and the release
process determine how this is to be approached with the supplier. Most
of this is achieved by supplementing existing processes, contract drafts
and tools.

The organisational procedure is regulated in *Em002-2 Instructions for
Publishing Open Source Software* and the associated tools.

**OSS is treated equally to proprietary software under procurement
law.** Since no licence fees are incurred for OSS according to the
definition of the Open Source Initiative (OSI), software can be
downloaded and used in principle without a tender. Only the services to
be provided by companies (e.g. support, engineering) are then subject to
procurement law and must be put out to tender.

Where necessary, the relevant aspects from the tools are integrated into
the Confederation's project management processes (i.e. HERMES).

Open development (direct open development on an openly accessible
repository) and participation in existing projects (contribution) are
also covered in the explanations in *[Em002-4 OSS Community Guidelines](em002-4.md)*.

# Objectives 

The following overarching, long-term objectives show how the Federal
Administration taps into the potential of open source software and
addresses the risks and challenges:

| **A) Compliance with legal requirements (i.e. EMOTA)** | The release of open source software is governed by Article 9 EMOTA. Compliance with this legal requirement is a key aspect of these guidelines and the associated documents. Federal authorities should comply with this article and maximise the benefits for the Federal Administration and Switzerland. The organisational units themselves are responsible for implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **B) Increase innovation and efficiency**              | Open source software serves as the basis of modern IT today. Building on the millions of freely available components and solutions, independent applications can be rapidly developed and operated. The associated time and resource savings and the architectural principles associated with open source software, such as interoperability, agility and microservices, increase the capacity for innovation and efficiency of software development. This in turn accelerates the digitalisation of the Federal Administration. By releasing open source software, the adoption of digital solutions can be accelerated in the federal environment and synergy effects can be utilised. |
| **C) Promote a culture of collaboration**              | Open source software promotes a culture of collaboration in IT through the sharing of source code, open communication and practices for joint further development. These principles can be applied to increase collaboration in IT within the Federal Administration, with the cantons and with other public institutions. This strengthens digital sovereignty and reduces dependencies on software vendors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **D) Create clarity and minimise risks**               | Information on frequently used open source licences should enable the Federal Administration to select the right licences. This minimises legal risks. Technical and legal recommendations enable the Federal Administration to use and release open source software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **E) Create an overview to utilise synergies**         | Open source software is currently used in numerous places within the Federal Administration in different ways. A lot of knowledge and experience is available, but the synergies cannot yet be utilised as there is no overview of the open source solutions in use. Such an overview and the joint procurement of services will make it possible to better exploit the potential of open source software, which saves resources and creates synergies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **F) Increase attractiveness as an IT employer**       | Open source software is popular with many highly qualified IT professionals. The use of modern open source technologies and the application of open source development methods motivate many employees and increase the attractiveness of the Federal Administration as an employer. To use open source software, the Confederation needs specialists with knowledge and experience of open source software, so efforts should be made when recruiting specialists to expand internal open source know-how.                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Building and participating in communities for project development is very important for OSS. A significant number of synergies result from this. It may be that the project already exists and the Confederation only participates, or the Confederation may lead the project, or indeed it may be a collaboration. Omitting a community is also an important decision. Direct development on an open repository\[17\] (without subsequent release) can bring further efficiency gains and promote joint development. Em002-4 provides guidance and motivation for community building by the federal authorities. |                                |

# Annexes

## Changes from previous version

  - Removal of all references to the Federal IT Steering Unit (FITSU).

  - Incorporation of changes relating to the implementation of Art. 9
    EMOTA. In addition to simple publications, scenarios are also
    assumed where an existing open source project can be expanded for
    federal purposes or collaborations take place.

  - This has resulted in the new objective A and derived measures:
    
      - > Measure 1 is now implementation of the practical guidelines.
    
      - > Measure 2: Publication of open source software with tools
    
      - > Measure 9: Examination of own publication platform. Promotion
        > of Open Development.

  - Procurement is supplemented with regard to Art. 9 EMOTA (Measure 3)

  - Measures 7 and 8 have been made more precise.
