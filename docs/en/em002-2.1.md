This checklist is part of *Em002-2 Instructions for Publishing Open*
Source Software*.* It should be completed at the start of a project or
when clarifying whether software does not need to be published.

The description of the checklist can be found in *\[Em002-2\]* in
Section 3.

This checklist can also be used to define whether development will be as
open development directly on a public repository.

For legacy code (developed before EMOTA came into force on 1.1.2024),
additional questions are provided.

Important: If software is not to be released as OSS, this checklist also
serves as justification for such a decision.

# Subject matter

## Name and brief description of the software

Enter the name of the software.  
This name should be identical in all subsequent OSS checklists to ensure
correct allocation.

|  |
|  |
|  |

Briefly describe the goal and purpose of the software.  
If a URL link exists, please also provide this.

## Contact person and review

Name the federal authority (organisational unit), contact person and the
persons responsible for the legal review (e.g. ISBO/DSBO) who have
verified compliance with the publication requirements.
