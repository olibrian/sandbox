# Tools for Publishing Open Source Software

Federal agencies are required to disclose the source code of software they develop or have developed to fulfill their duties. They must allow anyone to use, further develop, and distribute the software without charging licensing fees. This requirement is outlined in Article 9 of the Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for Fulfilling Administrative Tasks (EMOTA). Responsibility for implementation lies with the individual agencies. The Federal Chancellery provides suitable tools to assist federal agencies in meeting this requirement.

## What is it about?

When publishing open-source software, questions regarding legal matters, licenses, security, organization, and costs need to be addressed. Depending on the specific use case, there are variations and limitations to consider. The level of knowledge required to implement the legal requirement varies within the federal administration based on experience. For this reason, the Federal Chancellery has created tools and checklists to provide support and guidance for decision-making.

## Who is responsible?

The individual agencies are responsible for implementation. The Federal Chancellery provides suitable tools to assist federal agencies in this process.
